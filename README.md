# OpenAI Prompt Runner

A simple yet powerful tool to interact with OpenAI's API for various text analysis tasks. I built this to make it easier to analyze resumes, perform skill gap analysis, and handle other text-based tasks consistently.

## What it does

- üìù Analyzes resumes to extract skills (technical, functional, and soft skills)
- üéØ Performs detailed skill gap analysis between resumes and job descriptions
- üìä Generates quantified assessments with actionable recommendations
- üìë Summarizes text and analyzes sentiment
- üí° Generates creative ideas on any topic

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Quick Usage

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will run the default example of skill gap analysis between a resume and a job description.

## Sample prompt responses

*Skills Extraction:*

Prompt:

```
Please analyze the following resume text and extract three categories of skills:
1. Technical Skills: Hard skills related to specific technologies, tools, or technical knowledge
2. Functional Skills: Job-specific abilities and domain knowledge
3. Soft Skills: Interpersonal and behavioral traits

For each category, provide a comma-separated list of identified skills.
If a category has no identifiable skills, mark it as "None identified".

Resume text:
{resume_text}

Please format the response as follows:
Technical Skills: [list of skills]
Functional Skills: [list of skills]
Soft Skills: [list of skills]
```

Resume text:

```
Led a team of 5 developers to successfully migrate a legacy Java application 
to Python, implementing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker. 
Improved system performance by 40% through optimization and reduced deployment 
time by 60%. Conducted weekly team meetings and mentored 2 junior developers.
```

Response:

```
Technical Skills: Java, Python, Jenkins, Docker, CI/CD
Functional Skills: None identified
Soft Skills: Leadership, Mentorship
```

*Skill Gap Analysis:*

Prompt:

```
Perform a detailed skill gap analysis between the candidate's resume and the job description. 
        Follow these specific analytical steps:

        1. Skill Extraction and Quantification:
           - From Job Description: List required skills with their relative importance (Scale 1-5)
           - From Resume: List candidate's skills with their apparent proficiency level (Scale 1-5)
           Base these ratings on:
           - Years of experience
           - Project complexity described
           - Leadership/ownership level
           - Specific achievements mentioned

        2. Gap Analysis:
           - Calculate match scores for each skill area
           - Identify missing critical skills (importance ‚â•4)
           - Note areas where candidate exceeds requirements
           
        3. Recommendations:
           - Prioritize skill gaps by:
             * Importance to role (1-5)
             * Estimated time to acquire
             * Impact on job performance
           - Suggest specific learning paths or certifications

        Format the response as follows:
        
        SKILL REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
        [List skills from JD with importance ratings]

        CANDIDATE SKILL ASSESSMENT
        [List candidate's skills with proficiency ratings]

        GAP ANALYSIS
        [Quantified gaps and matches]

        CRITICAL GAPS
        [List of high-priority missing skills]

        RECOMMENDATIONS
        [Prioritized action items]

        Resume text:
        {resume}

        Job Description:
        {jd} 
```

Resume text:

Response:

```
Skill Gap Analysis:
SKILL REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
- SQL (5)
- Python (4)
- Apache Spark (4)
- Hadoop (4)
- AWS/Azure (3)

CANDIDATE SKILL ASSESSMENT
- SQL: 3
- Python: 5
- Apache Spark: 5
- Hadoop: 5
- AWS/Azure: 0

GAP ANALYSIS
- SQL: Candidate lacks proficiency (Gap: -2)
- Python: Candidate exceeds requirement (Match: +1)
- Apache Spark: Candidate meets requirement (Match: +1)
- Hadoop: Candidate meets requirement (Match: +1)
- AWS/Azure: Candidate lacks proficiency (Gap: -3)

CRITICAL GAPS
- SQL
- AWS/Azure

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Prioritize learning SQL as it is a critical skill for the role (Importance: 5, Time to acquire: Short, Impact: High)
2. Obtain certification in AWS or Azure to improve proficiency in cloud platforms (Importance: 4, Time to acquire: Medium, Impact: Medium)
```


## Customizing the Prompt

The prompt manager is designed to be easily customizable. You can modify the prompts in `src/prompt_manager.py` to suit your specific needs.

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory in JSON format with the following information:
- Timestamp
- Log level
- Module
- Message
- Input prompt
- API response

## TODO

- Add more prompts for different tasks (e.g. resume summary, cover letter, etc.)
- Add more LLMs to choose from
- Increase informativity of the prompts
