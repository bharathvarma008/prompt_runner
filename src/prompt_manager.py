        Perform a detailed skill gap analysis between the candidate's resume and the job description. 
        Follow these specific analytical steps:

        1. Skill Extraction and Quantification:
           - From Job Description: List required skills with their relative importance (Scale 1-5)
           - From Resume: List candidate's skills with their apparent proficiency level (Scale 1-5)
           Base these ratings on:
           - Years of experience
           - Project complexity described
           - Leadership/ownership level
           - Specific achievements mentioned

        2. Gap Analysis:
           - Calculate match scores for each skill area
           - Identify missing critical skills (importance â‰¥4)
           - Note areas where candidate exceeds requirements
           
        3. Recommendations:
           - Prioritize skill gaps by:
             * Importance to role (1-5)
             * Estimated time to acquire
             * Impact on job performance
           - Suggest specific learning paths or certifications
